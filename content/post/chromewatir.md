I am happy to announce that the first version of ChromeWatir has been released today. ChromeWatir is a port of watir for google chrome browser. The API follows a similar convention to Watir but there are a few differences. Please visit the [ChromeWatir Google code](http://code.google.com/p/chrome-watir/) for more details.	

We are in the process of making it better by stabilizing it as well adding more functionality.

The first release is available as gem as well as source in the downloads page. Please have a try and give the feedback :)
